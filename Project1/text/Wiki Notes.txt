Notes: 
1. I am using DreamWeaver Bootstrap - eCommerce Starter Template for Project 1. 
Different styles used from Bootstrap: 
1.1 - Navbar: 
	- .navbar-brand: webpage logo
	- .navbar-toggler .navbar-collapse: adjustment of the navbar on a smaller screen
	- .navbar-dark: controls the color of the text in the navbar
	- .bg-dark: gives a black background color to the navbar
	(https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/navbar/)
1.2 - Carousel: 
	- Slides: The .active class to one of the carousel image, makes the carousel visible. 
			  The .d-block and .w-100 on carousel images to prevent browser default image alignment.
	- Controls: The previous and next controls are done with <a> elements with role="button". 
	- Indicators: Tells you which slide you are on. Done by .carousel-indicators. 
	- Captions: Lets you see the text on the slide. Done by .carousel-caption. 
				.d-none makes the caption invisible on the small screen. 
				.d-md-block brings the caption back on medium-sized devices.

1.3 - Bootstrap Grid System: 
	Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns or a multiple of 12 columns across the page. 
	It uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. So, you have to have a .col-*-* inside a .row inside a .container. 
	So, I am having 28 products in shop.html because 28 is a mulitple of 4 (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/layout/grid/). 
1.4 - Card: 
	Using .card to display the image, title, description/price of the products on the home, shop, and the individual product pages.
